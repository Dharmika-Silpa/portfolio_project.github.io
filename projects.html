    <p>My project is virtual assistant,which is developed
         using the language python. In this modern era,day
        to day life became smarter and interlinked with technology.
        We already know some voice assistant like google,siri.etc. <br><br>
        Now in our voice assistant system,it can act as a basic
         prescriber,daily schedule reminder,note writer,calculator 
         and a search tool.This project works on voice input and give output
          through voice and displays the text on the screen. <br><br>

          voice assistance makes people smart and give instant and computed results.
          The voice assistance takes the voice input through our microphone converts 
          our voice into computer understandable language gives the required solutions
